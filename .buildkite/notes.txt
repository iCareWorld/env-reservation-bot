## Steps:

docker compose run --rm compile .buildkite/bundle.sh

Add a new app in Slack, load the config from the manifest, and customise names etc
Generate the slack verification token
Install the app to the workspace, then you can generate the oauth token

Put these into AWS Parameter Store
/reservationbot/slack.bot.oauth.token - from https://api.slack.com/apps/YOURAPP/oauth
/reservationbot/slack.verification.token from https://api.slack.com/apps/YOURAPP/general
/reservationbot/supported.envs - set this as a comma separated list

docker compose run --rm -w "/opt/app/" serverless sls deploy --verbose

to deploy the stack

Go to https://api.slack.com/apps/YOURAPP/event-subscriptions and put in the list action URL, e.g.

https://xxxxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/list
